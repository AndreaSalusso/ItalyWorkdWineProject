# Italy World Wine Project

Italy World Wine, an Italian wine company, needs to improve its marketing methods for selling wine in the United States. 

In order to increase its performance in the same market, the company aims to acquire a strategic orientation that is more suited to the needs of the US market.

To this end, they commissioned a study to determine how several sorts of elements, such as intrinsic and extrinsic product attributes, habits and consumption scenarios, consumer perceptions, and demographic variables, influence the inclination to buy Italian wine on the American market.
